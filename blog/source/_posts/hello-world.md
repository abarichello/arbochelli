# Hello World

## Introduction

I made this website to host the sheet music that I create for free.

## Tech

### Main website
The main website uses the [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) `file_server` directive with a custom template. The JavaScript is generated using the [Haxe](https://haxe.org) language so I can use the statically typed Browser API together with other Haxe features.

### Blog website
The blog portion of the website is created using [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) as the static site generator together with the [Solar theme](https://github.com/tzvetkov75/solar-theme-hexo) as a template.
